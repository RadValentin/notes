## Topic 1 - Design Process

### 1.0 Introduction to the course

Design is iterative, formative and not in isolation. Design can be learned from various fields.

### 1.1 What is Interaction Design

Interaction design is about how human interact with technology, with other human beings, in a meaningful useful way.

The main aim of Interaction Design is to add value to people's lives.

Ways to conceptualise interaction design, common design orientation:

- **Goal-oriented Design**: can I achieve this thing? can I do it well?
- **Scenario-oriented Design**: can I achieve an intended outcome? the steps involved in success or failure. All the different movement path to get the end point.
- **Story-oriented Design**: user journey. It might not have one single goal. Broad scope, but not unlimited. It flows, it goes in different ways, a lot is going on.

The design orientation above are the commons ways to conceptualise, in the end, context is key when it comes to the various orientations here.

### 1.2 The history of interaction design

The five (5) dimensions of Interaction Design:

- **Words**: Simple, clear language (might not even need language!). Be consistent with things that already exist.
- **Visual Representation**: Visuals are helpful. Inconsistency in how we use visuals can be confusing. If unsure, utilise other techniques to augment understanding. Some people are familiar with existing system, i.e. minimise icon, etc. "Don't reinvent the wheel" and "Don't confuse people". Understand the user prior experience.
    - Jacob's Law: https://lawsofux.com/jakobs-law/
- **Space & Proximity**: Borrow from the physical world. Affordances (when we look at light switch, it can be switch on or off) / metaphors can help. Menus, buttons and layouts do not exist in isolation. Proximity helps to establish a relationship with nearby objects. Proximity helps users understand and organise information faster and more efficiently.
    - Law of Proximity: https://lawsofux.com/law-of-proximity/
- **Time**: A tricky construct as we cannot go backwards. Changes and persistence can causes confusion. Try to signpost rather than just relying entirely on one dimension. Decide if that particular animation can add value or create confusions.
    - Zeigarnik Effect: https://lawsofux.com/zeigarnik-effect/
- **Behaviour**: People are complex, deeply individualised. What lessons can we learn? How can we accommodate people? Behaviour is dynamic, adaptive, changing over time. When we making a change, we need to evaluate whether does it impact user behaviour and whether it still align to the goal, scenario or story – can we validate it?

**History of Interaction Design**

In the 80s, people starts to think about how system can be designed to meet the needs of individuals who are now using these systems. As technology and technology usages grew, general people becomes users where initially they were predominantly for selected few groups, especially those who are technically inclined.

Some programmes has learning curves, it can be efficient for some people, it may be unusable for some. Example of this is VIM or Emacs or Terminal (command line interface applications). Such challenges, give rise to very common design style called WIMP, which we are familiar today.

**WIMP stands for:**

- **W**indows or tabs.
- **I**cons and signs.
- **M**enus and sub-menus.
- **P**ointers, e.g your mouse.

This style or the 'desktop metaphor' is initially popularised by the Macintosh operating system. They are not necessary the only way, but it does gives people the prior familiarity to this desktop style of environment that we have today and we are stuck by it. This is an example of a learned affordance.

### 1.3 The aims of interaction design

**Usability**: Start with bad and learn. Intervention can create obstacles and confusion. The world around us has lots of good and bad examples of usability engineering. Don't create things that confuses people.

**Be mindful**: The digital world is a bit different. Experiences need context. Be careful with how feature rich your applications are. There is such a thing as too much functionality!

### 1.4 Introduction to User Centred Design

The idea of uncomfortable interactions.

Deliberately and systematically creating uncomfortable interactions are a powerful cultural experiences under the general headings of entertainment, enlightenment and sociality. Examples can be found in horror films, theme parks, etc.

### 1.5 The Double Diamond Approach to Design

We can simplify the design process, with meaning and structure we want to do. One of the ways is the Double Diamond design process.

### 1.6 Jobs to be Done (JTBD) Theory

Summary of the article, https://jtbd.info/2-what-is-jobs-to-be-done-jtbd-796b82081cca

> Upgrade your user, not your product. Don't build better cameras – build better photographers
> – Kathy Sierra

A Job to be Done (JTBD) theory is neither found nor spontaneously created. Rather, it is designed. It is a theory of consumer action, it is the process a consumer goes through whenever she aims to change her existing life-situation into a preferred one, but cannot because there are constraints that stop her.

<img src="assets/Pasted image 20231015224849.png" />

Humans are limited in our abilities. 

<img src="assets/Pasted image 20231015225006.png" />

Jobs are user-focused and take into account things like contextual implications.


## Topic 2 - Models

We delves into the concept of modelling, particularly within the realm of interaction design. It encourages thinking beyond the familiar and illustrates the process through various examples of modelling. It highlights the significance of breaking down complex systems into their component parts to gain a deeper understanding of interactions and processes. It underscores the role of modelling in identifying problems and crafting effective design solutions. Ultimately, modelling allows for a comprehensive exploration of how a system works, and this understanding can lead to improved processes and solutions in the field of interaction design.

### 2.0 Introduction to Models

Model is a constructs and thinking around the basic components that make up interaction design.

<img src="assets/Pasted image 20231022193508.png" />

Example, a stickman is a model of a human being.

Unified Modeling Language (UML) is one example of a visual modeling language that is intended to provide a standard way to visual the design of a system.

### 2.1 Models for Design

There are a number of models for design, all models model the way in which we can work in order to substantiate some sets of achievements.

#### 2.1.1 Spiral Models

<img src="assets/Pasted image 20231022194227.png" />

The Spiral model is a sophisticated iterative design approach in software development that allows for incremental development and continuous refinement of a product throughout its lifecycle. It divides the project into a series of cycles or "spirals," each consisting of four key phases: planning, risk analysis, engineering, and evaluation.

1. **Planning**: In this phase, the project's objectives and requirements are established. The team outlines the scope, features, and any potential risks. It's essentially a high-level roadmap for the project.

2. **Risk Analysis**: During this stage, the team identifies potential risks and uncertainties that could affect the project. These could be technical, operational, or market-related risks. The focus is on understanding and mitigating these risks.

3. **Engineering**: This phase involves actual development, where the product is designed, coded, and tested. The spiral model allows for the creation of prototypes, which are valuable for early user feedback and verification of key design aspects.

4. **Evaluation**: After the product is built, it's evaluated, both by the development team and often by end-users. The results of this evaluation influence the planning phase of the next spiral, allowing for refinements and adjustments based on real-world feedback.

The Spiral model is highly adaptive and flexible. It caters to projects with evolving requirements and those that involve significant technical or market uncertainties. Its iterative nature allows for ongoing improvements and adjustments, ensuring that the final product meets user expectations.

One of the significant advantages of the Spiral model is its focus on risk management. By systematically identifying and addressing risks throughout the development process, it helps in reducing the likelihood of costly failures or project delays.

Moreover, the ability to build prototypes at each phase enables early validation of design concepts and functionality, making it easier to accommodate changes and adapt to shifting project needs.

In summary, the Spiral model is an advanced approach to software development that promotes incremental progress, risk management, and the creation of prototypes to ensure a more robust and user-friendly end product. It's particularly well-suited for complex projects with changing requirements and high levels of uncertainty.

#### 2.1.2 Waterfall Model

<img src="assets/Pasted image 20231022195001.png" />

The Waterfall model, an older approach to software development, has a long history of successful use, particularly in projects that demand a strict and unchanging focus. It remains a valuable method for designing and developing systems for some projects.

The Waterfall model is characterised by a sequential and rigid structure. It assumes that project requirements are well-understood and will remain relatively stable throughout the development process. This model is often used in projects with clear and unchanging requirements, such as those in heavily regulated industries or where significant changes are costly or not feasible.

However, one of the primary limitations of the Waterfall model is its lack of flexibility. It doesn't handle changes in requirements well, and addressing such changes can be cumbersome and expensive. As a result, it may not be the best choice for projects with evolving or uncertain requirements.

In summary, the Waterfall model is a straightforward and structured approach to software development, where each phase must be completed before moving to the next. It is best suited for projects with well-defined and stable requirements but may not be adaptable to projects with changing or evolving needs.

### 2.2 Modelling User

#### 2.2.2 Introduction to the Human Processor

<img src="assets/Pasted image 20231022202151.png" />

While many development models have historically prioritised the system or technical aspects, there is merit in initially focusing on modelling the users.

Users are diverse and unique, modelling them and understanding their capabilities can be a valuable step in designing effective interactions.

1. **Modelling Users and Computers**: Just as we model computers by understanding their inputs, outputs, and processing power, we can model users by considering their sensory inputs, motoric outputs, and cognitive processing abilities. This model helps in understanding the range of possibilities for interactions.
    
2. **Sensory Inputs**: Users have various sensory inputs, such as visual information received through their eyes, audio cues through their ears, and haptic feedback that can be felt throughout their body. Wearable devices can also provide haptic information to users, which can be used to grab their attention.
    
3. **Motoric Outputs**: Users can interact with technology through motoric outputs, which involve their ability to manipulate physical objects, gestures, or movements. This can lead to more naturalistic interactions, as opposed to traditional button presses.
    
4. **Cognitive Processing**: Users have limited memory and processing capabilities. The note emphasises the importance of considering the limitations of a user's memory, such as long-term memory and working memory. It also discusses the concept of sensory memory and how it can affect user interactions.
    
5. **Design Considerations**: The study note stresses the importance of avoiding impossible design decisions. For example, it suggests that setting overly complex password requirements can lead to user frustration. Recognising information is often more user-friendly than requiring users to recall specific details.
    
6. **Innovative Interaction Design**: By understanding the model of the human, designers can make informed and sensible design decisions. This allows for the creation of more usable and innovative interactions that take advantage of the diverse capabilities of users.
    
7. **Avoiding Reductionism**: The note acknowledges that while the model might seem reductionist, it is a valuable tool for making early design decisions and ensuring that users' capabilities and limitations are considered.

This underscores the importance of modelling users in interaction design to create better user experiences. While all users are unique, understanding their sensory inputs, motoric outputs, and cognitive processing abilities can lead to more informed and user-friendly design decisions. 

**Modelling users helps designers avoid impossible designs and explore innovative interaction possibilities.**

#### 2.2.2 An Effective Example – Designing Ride Sharing App

**Scenario**: Imagine you are designing a mobile app for a ride-sharing service like Uber or Lyft. You want to create a user-friendly and efficient interaction for users to request rides and track their drivers.

**Modelling Users**:

1. **Sensory Inputs**: Users interact with the app through visual and audio inputs. They need to see the map, driver's information, and estimated arrival time. They also need to hear audio cues like driver arrival notifications.
    
2. **Motoric Outputs**: Users use their motor skills to navigate the app interface, tap on buttons, and input their desired locations. In this case, motoric outputs involve the physical interaction with the touchscreen of their mobile device.
    
3. **Cognitive Processing**: Users have limited working memory, and it's essential to consider this when designing the app. You should avoid overwhelming them with too many options at once and make the process of requesting a ride as straightforward as possible.

**Design Considerations**:

1. **Visual Design**: Knowing that users rely heavily on visual information, you would design the app with clear and intuitive visual cues. Maps should be easy to read, and information about the driver should be presented in a way that is easy to process.
    
2. **User Interface**: The user interface should be designed for touch interaction, ensuring that buttons and controls are large enough and well-spaced to accommodate users' natural gestures. You'd avoid complex gestures that might be challenging for some users to execute.
    
3. **Audio Feedback**: Considering the audio input, you'd implement clear and concise audio notifications for the user. For instance, you'd have a friendly and distinct sound to indicate the driver's arrival, ensuring the user doesn't miss it.
    
4. **Memory Load**: To avoid overloading users' working memory, the app should minimise the number of decisions users need to make in the process. For example, you might use GPS data to suggest the user's current location as the pickup point, reducing the cognitive load of typing in an address.

**Innovative Interaction Design**:

Based on the model of the user, you might come up with innovative features like voice commands. Users can say, "I need a ride to {destination}," reducing the reliance on typing and tapping. Additionally, you might use haptic feedback to alert users of their driver's proximity by making their phone vibrate in a pattern that indicates the driver's distance.

By modelling the users and understanding their sensory inputs, motoric outputs, and cognitive processing, you've created an interaction design that is user-centric. It ensures that the app is intuitive, efficient, and accessible to a broad range of users, regardless of their individual abilities and preferences. The result is a more effective and user-friendly ride-sharing app that caters to diverse user needs and capabilities.

### 2.3 Fitts' Law

<img src="assets/Pasted image 20231022205457.png" />

<img src="assets/Pasted image 20231022205718.png" />

> The time to acquire a target is a function of the distance to and size of the target.

1. Touch targets should be large enough for users to accurately select them.
2. Touch targets should have ample spacing between them.
3. Touch targets should be placed in areas of an interface that allow them to be easily acquired.

<img src="assets/Pasted image 20231022202852.png" />

Reference: https://lawsofux.com/fittss-law/

Fitts' Law predicts how humans interact with objects on screens, offering insights into HCI, ergonomics, and interface design. The model measures the difficulty of tasks and involves parameters like 2D distance to the target's centre and target width. It emphasises navigating to the target's centre, not its edges. Fitts' Law works consistently across various interaction scenarios and demographics. An extension, Index of Performance (IP), combines the Index of Difficulty (ID) with movement time to assess performance. Fitts' Law can be explored and applied in diverse contexts.

### 2.4 Goals, Operators, Methods, Selections (GOMS) Framework

#### 2.4.1 GOMS

GOMS is a modelling techniques used to understand how user interacts with systems and how they achieve their goals within a system. The key constructs of GOMS are as follows:

1. **Goals**: Goals represent what the user intends to accomplish within the system. Users have specific objectives in mind when using a system, and GOMS aims to evaluate whether the user can achieve those objectives.
2. **Operators**: Operators are actions performed to reach a goal. They are the basic building blocks that allow users to interact with the system. For example, clicking a checkbox to change its state is considered an operator.
3. **Methods**: Methods are sequences of operators that work together to achieve a specific goal. Methods can consist of multiple steps and stages, depending on the complexity of the goal. The sequence of operators in a method accomplishes the intended goal.
4. **Selections**: Selections acknowledge that there can be multiple methods available to achieve a goal. Users may have choices in how they accomplish their objectives within a system. The selection process involves making choices among different available methods.

<img src="assets/Pasted image 20231105192042.png" />

Users may have individual differences in how they approach and achieve their goals. GOMS is a way to build a knowledge repository about these interactions, considering various paths to reach the desired outcome.

GOMS provides a structured way to model and understand user interactions with a system, which is essential for usability and human-computer interaction studies. This modeling technique can help in designing systems that are more intuitive and user-friendly by taking into account the diverse ways users might achieve their goals.

#### 2.4.2 GOMS-KLM, GOMS-Keystroke Level Model (-KLM)

GOMS-KLM extends GOMS framework.

The keystroke level model (KLM) provides a more detailed and granular perspective on user interactions with a system, specifically in terms of the physical actions involved in accomplishing tasks.

1. **Keystroke Level Model**: This model delves into the finer details of user interactions by considering the specific physical actions users perform when using a system. These actions include pressing keys on a keyboard, moving a mouse, pointing, and clicking. The goal is to understand the time it takes to complete each action accurately.
2. **Operators and Interactions**: The keystroke level model breaks down interactions into various steps, such as pointing, pressing or releasing the mouse button, and typing keystrokes. These steps are considered operators and are part of a user's workflow.
3. **Homing and Mental Preparation**: The model also accounts for tasks like "homing," which involves transitioning between input devices like a keyboard and a mouse, and "mentally preparing" for tasks. Mental preparation factors in the cognitive aspects of task execution.
4. **Reaction Time**: Users have a certain reaction time, which is the time it takes to respond to a specific stimulus or task. This reaction time can vary based on the nature and complexity of the task at hand.
5. **Benefits of Granular Modeling**: The keystroke level model offers the advantage of modeling user interactions at a very detailed level, providing insights into the time required for various tasks. This modeling approach can help optimize processes and systems without direct user testing, making it a valuable tool for designing and improving systems.

The keystroke level model, in conjunction with the GOMS framework, enables a comprehensive understanding of how users interact with systems and can guide system design and optimization efforts.

#### 2.4.3 Example

Certainly! GOMS (Goals, Operators, Methods, and Selection rules) and KLM (Keystroke-Level Model) are used to analyze and predict the time it takes to perform tasks. Let's consider a real-world example of how GOMS-KLM could be applied to a common task: making a sandwich.

1. **Goal:** The user's goal is to make a sandwich.
2. **GOMS Analysis:**
   - **Goals (G):** The main goal is to assemble a sandwich.
   - **Operators (O):** These are the basic actions involved, such as spreading, slicing, and stacking.
   - **Methods (M):** These are the sequences of operators to achieve subgoals. For example, one method might be for making a ham and cheese sandwich, and another for a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
   - **Selection Rules (S):** These are the decision points, such as choosing ingredients based on user preferences or dietary restrictions.
3. **KLM Analysis:**
   - **Keystroke-Level Model:** This model breaks down the time required for each operator. Here's how it might look for making a sandwich:
     - **K1 (Keystroke):** This represents the time it takes to type specific keys. In this context, it doesn't apply.
     - **K2 (Pointing):** This represents the time to move a pointing device (e.g., a mouse) to a target. When reaching for ingredients in the kitchen, it takes time to reach for items in the fridge, pantry, or countertop.
     - **K3 (Button Press):** This represents the time to press a button. When spreading condiments or cutting ingredients, the time it takes to exert force with a knife or spatula can be considered a button press.
     - **K4 (Mental Preparation):** This is the time required to prepare mentally for an action. For instance, thinking about what ingredients to use and planning the sandwich's construction.
     - **K5 (System Response Time):** The time it takes for the system (in this case, the kitchen environment) to respond. For example, waiting for the toaster to pop or the refrigerator door to open.

Here's a breakdown of the process using GOMS-KLM for making a ham and cheese sandwich:

- **GOMS Goals and Methods:**
   - G1: Assemble ingredients (ham, cheese, bread, condiments).
   - G2: Prepare bread by spreading condiments.
   - G3: Assemble sandwich components.
- **KLM Operators (considering time estimates):**
   - K2: Reach for ham and cheese (time to move to the fridge and grab the items).
   - K3: Slice cheese (time to exert force when using a knife).
   - K2: Reach for bread (time to move to the bread and pick it up).
   - K3: Spread condiments (time to exert force when using a butter knife).
   - K2: Reach for ham (time to move to the ham and pick it up).
   - K3: Assemble sandwich (time to exert force when stacking ingredients).

The GOMS-KLM analysis can help estimate the time it takes to make a sandwich, considering the various operators and methods involved. It's a simple example, but it demonstrates how such models can be applied to analyze and predict task performance and understand where time is spent during the task.

### 2.5 Norman's Action Cycle

"Norman's Action Cycle," a concept introduced by Donald Norman, a prominent figure in the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and design psychology.

Donald Norman is recognized as a pioneer in the field of HCI, contributing significantly to our understanding of how design concepts and psychology relate to interactions with systems. His work has shaped the field of interaction design and usability.

The Action Cycle is a simple yet insightful model that describes the interactions between users and systems. It focuses on the cyclic nature of interactions, moving away from the linear input-output model.

In Norman's model, there are two primary steps in the interaction cycle, both implicit:

<img src="assets/Pasted image 20231105194923.png" />

- **Execution**: This step involves the user interacting with the system, performing actions such as clicking, typing, swiping, etc. It's the phase where the user imparts input to the system.
- **Evaluation**: After executing an action, there is a period of evaluation where the user waits to observe the system's response. It's during this phase that users assess whether the desired outcome has been achieved.

The cycle can **repeat (iterative process)** if the user's execution did not yield the desired result. This repetition can occur if an action is incorrect or if the system's response is not as expected.

Norman's Action Cycle provides a valuable framework for modeling interactions and understanding the user-system relationship. It underscores the significance of a smooth, efficient user experience, where users can execute actions and quickly evaluate the system's response without the need for extensive corrections.

<img src="assets/Pasted image 20231105195043.png" />

In modeling human-computer interactions, two key concepts are the "Gulf of Execution" and the "Gulf of Evaluation." These terms represent fundamental aspects of the interaction between users and systems:
#### 2.5.1 Gulf of Execution (User -> System)

<img src="assets/Pasted image 20231105195207.png" />

- It signifies the gap between what a user intends to do and what the system allows them to do.
- Users navigate this gap to execute actions and achieve their goals within the system.
- The Gulf of Execution represents the process of turning user intentions into system actions.

#### 2.5.2 Gulf of Evaluation (System -> User)

<img src="assets/Pasted image 20231105195432.png" />

- This is the counterpart to the Gulf of Execution.
- It refers to the gap between the system's output or feedback and the user's ability to interpret and evaluate that feedback.
- In the Gulf of Evaluation, users assess the system's state to determine whether their objectives have been met.

#### 2.5.3 Example

Let's consider a real-world example of Norman's Action Cycle using a common task: sending an email with an email client, such as Gmail. In this context, we'll explore how the Action Cycle applies:

1. **Goal:** The user's goal is to send an email to a friend.
2. **Execution:**
   - **Physical Actions:** The user interacts with the computer (e.g., using a mouse and keyboard) to compose the email, addressing it to the recipient, typing the message, and attaching files if needed.
   - **System Response:** As the user types, the email client responds by displaying the text and updating the user interface in real-time. Auto-suggestions may appear for email addresses and spelling corrections.
3. **Evaluation:**
   - **User's Evaluation:** The user evaluates the email content, proofreads for errors, checks that the attached files are correct, and ensures that everything is in order.
   - **System's Evaluation:** The email client may provide feedback by underlining misspelled words, displaying a character/word count, and indicating if attachments are successfully uploaded.
4. **Outcome:**
   - **Desired Outcome:** If the user is satisfied with the email's content and attachments, and the recipient's address is correct, the user proceeds to send the email.
   - **Undesired Outcome:** If there are errors or issues, the user may need to make corrections in the execution phase before achieving the desired outcome.
5. **Iterative Process:** Users may go back and forth between execution and evaluation. For example, if they notice a typo in the email content during evaluation, they may return to the execution phase to correct it.

In this example, the Norman's Action Cycle illustrates how the user interacts with the email client, continually transitioning between execution (composing the email) and evaluation (reviewing and correcting the email's content and attachments) until they are satisfied with the message and can successfully send it to achieve their goal. The cycle showcases the importance of seamless interaction and effective feedback from the email client to ensure the user's intended goal is met.

### 2.6 General User Mental Models

The concept of a mental model is crucial in understanding how users perceive and interact with systems. Here's a real-world example to illustrate the idea:
#### 2.6.1 Example

**Thermostat Control**

Suppose you have a home thermostat, and your goal is to make your room warmer. You look at the thermostat, and it's currently set at 12 degrees Celsius. Your mental model of the thermostat and how it works suggests that if you want to increase the temperature, you should turn the dial to a higher value, like 20 degrees Celsius. In your mind, adjusting it to 20 degrees should lead to a warmer room.

However, what's interesting is that many people turn the thermostat further, perhaps all the way to 30 degrees Celsius, thinking it will heat up the room faster. This might not align with the laws of physics, but it makes sense within their mental model. Their assumption is that a higher setting will produce more heat and reach the desired temperature more quickly.

This example highlights how people's mental models can sometimes lead to actions that may not align with the technical operation of a system. It's a case where user expectations, based on their experiences and understanding, guide their interactions with the system. Understanding these mental models is critical in user interface and system design to meet users' expectations effectively.

The example also shows the importance of adhering to **common conventions in design**, such as **not drastically changing the expected behaviour of everyday objects** like thermostats unless there's a compelling reason to do so. Breaking conventions should be done carefully and with proper communication to users to avoid confusion.

#### 2.6.2 Seven (7) Stages of Action

This seven-stage Action Cycle model provides a detailed breakdown of the cognitive processes involved in human interactions with the world. It starts with perceiving sensory data from the environment, followed by interpreting and evaluating this data to make informed decisions. Then, there's an intention to act, which leads to the performance of a sequence of actions. Finally, there's execution of these actions, resulting in feedback that triggers a return to perceiving new data from the environment.

<img src="assets/Pasted image 20231105201205.png" />

Each of the seven stages in the Action Cycle:

1. **Perception**: This stage involves the reception of sensory data from the environment. It's the initial step where individuals become aware of their surroundings through their senses, such as sight, sound, touch, taste, and smell. Perception sets the foundation for further cognitive processing.
2. **Interpretation**: After perceiving sensory data, individuals engage in interpretation. During this stage, they make sense of the sensory information, assigning meaning and significance to what they've observed. It's where personal experiences, cultural backgrounds, and prior knowledge come into play, influencing how data is understood.
3. **Evaluation**: Evaluation is a critical step where individuals assess the interpreted information. They decide how to react based on their understanding of the data. This may involve considering potential consequences, determining the relevance of the information, and weighing various courses of action.
4. **Intention to Act**: In this stage, individuals form an intention to act based on the outcome of their evaluation. They decide on the specific actions they need to take to achieve their goals or respond to the situation at hand. This step represents a commitment to a particular course of action.
5. **Sequence of Actions**: The intention to act leads to the formulation of a sequence of actions. These are the specific steps and tasks required to execute the intended action. The sequence of actions can vary in complexity and may involve multiple sub-tasks and decisions.
6. **Execution of Actions**: At this point, individuals execute the actions they've planned in the previous stage. This execution phase involves physically carrying out the intended tasks. It's where their actions translate into changes in the environment or interactions with systems and technology.
7. **Feedback and Return to Perception**: After executing the actions, individuals experience feedback from the environment or the system. This feedback informs them about the consequences of their actions. Based on this feedback, they may need to return to the perception stage, perceiving new sensory data or observing changes in the environment, to continue the cycle of interaction.

The model highlights the complexity of human cognition and behaviour in response to external stimuli. It demonstrates the iterative and interconnected nature of these cognitive processes as individuals interact with the world and strive to achieve their goals. Understanding these stages can be invaluable in designing and optimising user interactions with systems, considering how people perceive, interpret, and execute actions within an environment.


## Topic 3 - Understanding Users

In this topic, we discuss the importance of understanding user motivations and needs in the context of designing user interactions with systems.

<img src="assets/Pasted image 20231105201807.png" />

The focus is on exploring what information designers need to create positive user experiences. Users' motivations and actions can vary, and designers should account for complexity in interactions. The goal is to identify the complex steps between a user's motivation and the achievement of a goal. The complexity is influenced by various factors like user interaction methods, preconceived understanding of the system, learning, memory, and the user's capability.

### 3.1 Information We Need

#### 3.1.1 User Tasks

We discuss the concept of tasks in the context of designing user experiences for systems. The importance of understanding and modelling the various actions and stages involved in a task to enable users to achieve their goals efficiently.

1. **Understanding User Interactions**: The discussion begins by highlighting the importance of understanding user interactions with a system and how these interactions can be explicit to improve user experiences.
    - Example – in the case of a social media platform, understanding how users engage with posts, like, comment, or share content, is essential for enhancing the platform's usability.
2. **Defining Tasks**: Tasks are defined as the manifestation of activities that allow users to achieve specific goals, such as reading a book or completing a degree program.
    - Example – an online shopping task may involve actions like browsing products, adding items to the cart, entering payment information, and confirming the purchase.
4. **Complex Nature of Tasks**: Tasks are often composed of multiple steps, actions, and stages. 
    - Example – pursuing a degree involves various activities like examinations, coursework, reading, watching videos, and discussions with peers.
5. **Interaction Possibilities**: Users have various objects and interaction possibilities within a system, such as books, videos, and different ways of learning. These diverse options contribute to dynamic and flexible learning experiences.
    - Example – In the context of a cooking app, users may have objects like ingredients, recipes, and utensils, and they can interact with the app by reading recipes, watching video tutorials, or adjusting serving sizes.
6. **Consideration of User Perspectives**: Highlights the importance of considering user perspectives, conscious objects, and how different interactions can complement each other to achieve a specific goal.
    - Example – In the case of a fitness app, users may have the perspective of tracking their workouts, monitoring nutrition, and receiving motivational messages, all contributing to their overall health and fitness goals.
7. **Granular Analysis of Tasks**: When designing systems, it's essential to break down tasks into detailed steps and stages to ensure that users can achieve their objectives effectively. This granular approach is crucial for designing user-friendly systems.
    - Example – a task like booking a flight online involves steps such as searching for flights, selecting a seat, providing passenger information, and making a payment. 
8. **Flexibility and Nuance**: Users can choose different routes and tools to complete tasks, making the process dynamic and adaptable. Designers need to account for these variations.
    - Example – In a project management software, team members may choose to interact with tasks using a web interface, mobile app, or even voice commands, showcasing the adaptability of the system to different interaction preferences.
9. **Complexity of Tasks**: Some tasks, like flying an aircraft or operating complex systems, involve intricate procedures, mathematics, and engineering knowledge, highlighting the challenges of designing such systems.

It is important to understand and model user tasks in a granular manner to create effective and user-friendly systems, acknowledging the dynamic and nuanced nature of user interactions and tasks.

#### 3.1.2 The Environment and Other Systems

Let's think about the broader considerations in the field of interaction design. These considerations extend beyond users and tasks and encompass the influence of the environment. We often don't deal in isolation.

1. **Impact of the Environment**: The environment plays a significant role in user interactions with systems. The physical environment can affect how people use technology. 
    - Example – using a touch screen device in the rain can be challenging due to water interference.
2. **Designing for Environmental Context**: Designers must consider where a system will be used, who the users are, and how the environment may impact user interactions. 
    1. Example – designing mobile phones with adaptive backlighting control for sunny conditions allows users to read their screens outdoors.
3. **Adaptation to the Environment**: Both users and systems can adapt to the environment. 
    - Example – users may cover their PIN when using an ATM for privacy and security, and modern mobile phones can adjust screen brightness based on ambient light.
4. **Contextual Implications**: Interaction in various contexts can have different social norms. 
    - Example – it may be considered impolite to use a phone during a dinner with friends or colleagues. This highlights the need to consider the context of use when designing systems.
5. **Conformity to Standards**: Apart from legal standards, designers must consider social and contextual standards. Interactions can vary based on the people present and the dynamic of the situation, whether it's interacting with a phone, a smart TV, a laptop, or other devices.
6. **Complex Interactions**: Interaction designers face the challenge of integrating the three core aspects—users, tasks, and the environment—along with their intricate interactions. This holistic approach is crucial for designing effective and user-friendly systems.

In summary, we underscores the importance of considering the broader environment when designing systems, with real-world examples demonstrating how the physical and social context can significantly impact user interactions and design choices.

#### 3.1.3 Types of Data

How data can make informed decisions.

Data is often thought of as numerical representations, we recognise the importance of understanding data within the rich contexts in which it is collected. For example, data can help HCI professionals understand user behavior and system interactions.

Data is a crucial element in HCI, both in the early design stages to create prototypes meeting user needs and after the system is deployed for continuous improvement through analytics and user feedback. Data can be used at various stages of the HCI process, including planning, design, implementation, and evaluation. It serves as an essential resource for informing decisions.

##### 3.1.3.1 Quantitative Data

Quantitative data consists of numerical representations, figures, and orders, making it highly suitable for statistical analysis and comparisons.

**For example** – Some examples of quantitative data include completion rates, task time analysis, and the order and structure of actions.

Benefits:

- **Standardisation:** Quantitative data offers opportunities for standardisation, allowing for metrics, comparisons, and generalisability.
- **Generalisability:** It enables the drawing of conclusions about larger populations based on data collected.

Limitations:

- **Lack of Depth:** Quantitative data may lack depth and context, as it doesn't provide insights into the "why" behind the numbers.
- **Challenging Comparisons:** It can be challenging to compare, especially when dealing with complex and dynamic systems.

##### 3.1.3.2 Qualitative Data

Qualitative data is context-driven and focuses on describing experiences, scenarios, and the "why" behind human behaviours.

**For example** – Qualitative data examples include interviews, transcripts, video footage, and rich accounts of user experiences.

Benefits:

- **Rich Understanding:** Qualitative data provides a nuanced understanding of human behaviour and the motivations behind user actions.
- **Exploring Reasons:** It allows for exploration of the reasons and motivations behind user interactions and decisions.
- **Easier to Gather:** Qualitative data is often easier to gather and does not require advanced statistical tools.

Limitations:

- **Lack of Generalisability:** Qualitative data is not easily generalisable and may apply specifically to individuals or small groups.
- **Challenging Comparisons:** Due to its contextual nature, comparisons may be challenging.

##### 3.1.3.3 Combining Approaches

In many cases, a combination of both quantitative and qualitative data is recommended in HCI research. This approach provides a comprehensive view of user interactions and behaviors, offering both statistical insights and in-depth understanding.

In summary, understanding the distinctions between quantitative and qualitative data is crucial in HCI research. Each type has its unique characteristics, benefits, and limitations, and leveraging both can lead to more meaningful insights into user behaviours and system interactions.

There is no one-size-fits-all approach, and it's often beneficial to mix quantitative and qualitative data in HCI research to gain a comprehensive view of user interactions and behaviours.

### 3.2 Data Collection

In interaction design, gathering data is essential to creating user-friendly systems. This data helps in making informed design decisions. 
#### 3.2.1 Interview

One effective method for collecting rich and valuable data from potential users is through interviews. Interviews are an invaluable tool for interaction designers.

**Interviews vs. Job Interviews

You might associate interviews with high-pressure job interviews. However, interviews in interaction design are typically more informal and conversational. They resemble everyday conversations. Users are accustomed to having conversations, making them comfortable and more expressive.

**The Art of Listening in Interviews**

Effective interviewing involves asking questions and then listening actively. As an interviewer, it's crucial to refrain from sharing your opinions or dominating the conversation. This is in contrast to engaging conversations where you can express your thoughts. The key in interviews is to let the participants share their thoughts and insights.

**Benefits of Interviews in Interaction Design**

Interviews offer distinct advantages:

1. **Real-time Expression**: Interviews are verbal exchanges, enabling participants to immediately express their thoughts and feelings without the delay required in written responses.
2. **Flexibility**: Interviews allow adaptability; you can explore interesting tangents or related topics raised by the participants, fostering serendipitous data collection.

**Structured Interviews vs. Unstructured Interviews**

The structure of interviews can vary. They fall on a spectrum from highly structured to unstructured:

- **Unstructured Interviews (Low Structured)**: These open-ended interviews have no predefined list of questions. Interviewers have a general topic and engage in conversation. Ideal for early project stages when the specific questions aren't clear.
- **Structured Interviews (Highly Structured)**: In these interviews, interviewers arrive with a predefined list of questions and follow a specific order. This approach enables consistency and data comparison among participants.
- **Semi-Structured Interviews (Moderate Structured)**: These interviews strike a balance. The interviewer has a list of questions but can probe further based on participants' responses. They combine structure with flexibility.

**Choosing the Right Interview Style**

The choice between structured, semi-structured, or unstructured interviews depends on your goals and the stage of your project.

- Unstructured interviews are excellent for early explorations.
- Structured interviews facilitate data comparison and pattern recognition.
- Semi-structured interviews offer the best of both worlds by providing some structure while allowing flexibility for in-depth discussions.

**Avoiding the Correction Trap**

As an interviewer, resist the urge to correct participants when they share seemingly incorrect information. Correcting them can hinder the interview process and may make participants feel uncomfortable. For example, the interviewee will feel stupid and may reluctant to share correct information to avoid making them look stupid. Incorrect information can provide valuable insights into what users find difficult or unclear, which is critical for improving designs.

To enhance your interviewing skills and practice active listening without correcting, you can engage in an exercise. Ask a friend or family member probing questions about a topic you are passionate about, even if their understanding or opinions differ from yours. Listen attentively without providing corrections or counterarguments. This exercise will help you become a more effective interviewer in the field of interaction design.

In summary, interviews are powerful tools for gathering data in interaction design. The choice of interview structure depends on your research goals and project stage. Effective interviews involve active listening, allowing users to freely share their thoughts and experiences. By resisting the urge to correct participants, you can collect valuable data to inform your design decisions.

**How to Run an Interview**

1. **Choosing the Interview Type**: The type of interview you conduct should align with your project phase. Open-ended interviews are suitable for early exploration, while structured interviews are better for later stages to confirm or explore specific ideas.
2. **Design Clear Questions**: Ensure that your interview questions are clear, concise, and free of jargon. Avoid complex, multi-part questions that can confuse participants. Split questions with multiple components into separate ones.
3. **Question Justification**: Carefully consider every question you include. Remove any questions that don't contribute to your research goals. Don't add unnecessary questions that waste both your and the participant's time.
4. **Reflection**: After each interview, reflect on how it went. Assess the quality of the questions and whether any changes or adjustments are needed for future interviews.
5. **Consider Alternatives**: Always evaluate if interviews are the most suitable method for your research. They can be time-consuming, so you should justify their use and consider more efficient data collection methods.
6. **Participant Recruitment**: Choose participants who represent your target users or stakeholders. Consider their relevant experience, demographics, or interests. Whether you have a pool of participants or need to find them, select individuals who can provide valuable insights.
7. **Reimbursement**: In formal settings, offer reimbursement, such as money or vouchers, to participants to show respect for their time and effort.
8. **Ensuring Comfort**: Make sure both you and the participant are physically comfortable during the interview. Also, ensure that the participant understands the interview process.
9. **Audio Recording and Consent**: If you plan to record the interview, ask for the participant's consent at the beginning. Clearly explain the purpose of audio recording and ensure they are comfortable with it.
10. **Note-taking**: While audio recordings are valuable, they can be cumbersome to review. Take contemporaneous notes during the interview, jotting down key insights, quotes, or points of interest. This helps you navigate the recording later.
11. **Question Prioritization**: Identify essential questions that must be addressed and be prepared to skip or adapt others if time constraints arise. You should have a clear understanding of the priorities.
12. **Participant Control**: Inform participants that they can end the interview at any time. Respect their autonomy, especially if they find certain questions distressing.
13. **Use of Tools**: Consider using physical props or artifacts in the interview to spark conversation. Sketch paper can be useful for participants to visualize their thoughts or ideas. Be cautious not to commit to any design ideas as an interviewer.
14. **Icebreakers**: Start the interview with a few non-invasive, small talk questions to build rapport and make participants more comfortable. Small talk at the end of the interview can help gather additional insights and put participants at ease.

Remember that conducting interviews requires careful planning, adaptability, and a focus on collecting valuable data while respecting the comfort and autonomy of the participants.

#### 3.2.2 Focus Groups

While interview is usually one-to-one with another person, a focus group interviews a group of participants simultaneously. It involves an interviewer asking questions to a group of people, usually ranging from 3 to 10 participants.

**Benefits of Focus Groups**

1. **Idea Generation:** Focus groups create an environment where participants can spark ideas off one another and remind each other of things they may have missed. It allows for a more creative and collaborative discussion, potentially leading to innovative solutions.
2. **Common Consensus**: Focus groups can help identify common consensus or shared opinions among participants. By engaging a group of people in discussions, you can gain a better understanding of ideas and perspectives that are commonly shared among the users. This insight can be particularly valuable for interaction designers, as it provides a stronger indication of what issues or preferences are widely held by the target user group, rather than being representative of just one individual.
3. **Efficiency:** Focus groups are more efficient than individual interviews because one interviewer can collect data from multiple participants in a single session, making them a cost-effective option.
4. **Less Intimidating:** Focus groups can be less intimidating for participants compared to one-on-one interviews, as they are part of a group discussion rather than the sole focus.

**Challenges of Focus Groups**

1. **Groupthink:** One of the downsides is the potential for groupthink, where participants' opinions gradually converge into the same space, losing the diversity of perspectives. It's crucial to ensure that participants maintain distinct opinions.
2. **Loud Dominant Voices:** In a focus group, one person can dominate the discussion, which may lead to quieter participants not expressing their opinions. It's important to manage the conversation to ensure that everyone has an opportunity to speak.
3. **Facilitation:** Focus groups require skilled facilitation, as it can be challenging to manage the dynamics within the group, ensuring that all participants have the chance to express their views.

**Managing Focus Groups**

- Be clear about logistics and arrangements to ensure that participants arrive on time.
- Use audio recording to capture the discussion.
- Prepare a list of questions to guide the discussion, distinguishing between necessary and nice-to-have questions.
- Be prepared to adapt and manage the discussion on the fly, ensuring a balance of speaking time for participants.
- Polite interruption is key to facilitate balanced discussions, ensuring everyone gets an opportunity to share their opinions.

**Example of a Focus Group Artifact**

<img src="assets/Pasted image 20231105212416.png" />

The speaker shared an example of using a tangible interface, a tablecloth with conductive zippers, to manage a focus group about an immersive theater production. This allowed participants to physically indicate their responses on a Likert scale using zippers, with a tone indicating their choice. It helped the facilitator track responses and manage the conversation effectively.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, focus groups can be a valuable tool for interaction designers to collect data and insights from multiple participants, fostering creativity and efficient data gathering. However, they require careful facilitation to avoid groupthink and ensure all voices are heard. Using tools or artifacts, such as the example of the zippy tablecloth, can be beneficial in managing the dynamics of the group.

#### 3.2.3 Questionnaires / Survey

Questionnaires, like interviews and focus groups, are another valuable tool for gathering data in the field of interaction design. They offer distinct advantages and have their own set of considerations.

**Benefits of Questionnaires**

1. **Quantitative and Qualitative Data:** Questionnaires can be designed to collect both quantitative and qualitative data. Closed-ended questions with predefined responses allow for quantitative analysis, while open-ended questions capture qualitative insights.
2. **Standardized Data:** Closed questions, with structured response options, allow for standardized data collection. This makes it easier to compare and analyze responses across participants.
3. **Efficiency:** Questionnaires are an efficient way to collect data from a large number of participants simultaneously, especially when distributed electronically.
4. **Scalability:** They can be distributed widely, reaching a diverse group of users or participants, which can be particularly useful for larger user bases.
5. **Anonymity:** Participants can often remain anonymous, which can encourage more honest and unbiased responses, especially for sensitive topics.
6. **Flexibility:** The format of questionnaires can be adapted to suit the research goals, making them suitable for a wide range of research objectives.

**Considerations for Questionnaires**

1. **Closed vs. Open Questions:** Designers must choose between closed and open questions based on research goals. Closed questions provide structured responses for quantitative analysis, while open questions capture in-depth qualitative data.
2. **Question Wording:** The phrasing and wording of questions should be clear, unambiguous, and unbiased to ensure participants understand and respond accurately.
3. **Question Order:** The sequence of questions should be logical and organized to maintain participant engagement and prevent fatigue.
4. **Likert Scales:** The use of Likert scales (i.e. score 1 to 5) for closed questions can capture degrees of agreement, satisfaction, or preference, providing nuanced insights.
5. **Sampling Bias:** There may be bias in who responds to questionnaires, as they often rely on voluntary participation. Efforts should be made to reach a diverse and representative sample.
6. **Response Rate:** Low response rates can lead to sampling bias. Strategies to maximize response rates, such as reminders or incentives, should be considered.
7. **Data Analysis:** The analysis of questionnaire data can be time-consuming, particularly with open-ended responses. Tools and methods for efficient data processing should be employed.
8. **Validity and Reliability:** It's essential to ensure that questionnaires are designed to measure what they intend to measure (validity) and provide consistent results upon repeated administration (reliability).
9. **Ethical Considerations:** Designers must adhere to ethical principles, ensuring informed consent, data protection, and participant privacy.

**Designing Questionnaires**

1. **Right Questions:** To design an effective questionnaire, it's essential to ask the right questions. The questions should be aligned with the research goals and the information you want to gather about your users or participants.
2. **Data Sources:** Information from various sources, such as interviews, user requirements, or previous research, can inform the questionnaire design process. The existing knowledge about your target audience is invaluable.
3. **Complexity in Design:** Designing good questionnaires is a challenging task. There are subtleties in questionnaire design that need to be considered. The aim is to maximise the number of completed questionnaires while ensuring data validity.
4. **Number of Response Options:** A key question in questionnaire design is how many response options to provide for each question. Likert-style questions often have three, five, or other odd numbers of responses. This encourages respondents to express preferences instead of opting for a neutral response.
5. **Middle or Neutral Response:** Allowing a neutral or "Not Applicable" (N/A) response can lead to problems if participants use it to avoid engaging with the questions. Neutral responses may not yield meaningful insights and could result in invalid data.
6. **The Role of Odd Numbers:** Likert scales tend to use odd numbers to avoid giving respondents a middle ground. Odd numbers require participants to choose a positive or negative response, leading to more decisive answers.
7. **Scale Length:** The length of the scale, such as 1-10, can be adjusted based on the participants' level of involvement with the subject matter. Longer scales offer more granularity but may result in more complex data analysis.
8. **Data Analysis Challenges:** Longer scales or a larger number of response options can make data analysis more complex. Researchers must decide the appropriate level of granularity and consider how to interpret and quantify responses.
9. **Short and Relevant Questions:** Keep the questionnaire concise by including only relevant questions. Avoid overwhelming participants with excessive questions. Ensure that each question serves the research purpose.
10. **Analysis Method:** Consider the analysis method you'll use when designing the questionnaire. Different response types and scales may require distinct analysis techniques.
11. **Clear Question Wording:** The wording of questions should be clear, concise, unambiguous, and free from bias. Ambiguous questions can lead to misinterpretation and inaccurate responses.
12. **Sampling Considerations:** Ensure that the questionnaire is distributed to a diverse and representative sample of participants to avoid bias in the results.
13. **Ethical Considerations:** Adhere to ethical principles in questionnaire design, including informed consent, data protection, and participant privacy.

### 3.3 Observation

#### 3.3.1 The Problems of Observation

There are challenges and considerations of conducting observational research, specifically in an office or work environment. We discuss a known phenomenal  called the Hawthorne effect, which is a common issue in observational research.

1. **Observational Research**: Observing people in their natural environment, such as an office, is a valuable method for collecting rich, real-world data about their behaviours, interactions, and work processes.
2. **Hawthorne Effect**: The Hawthorne effect is a well-known phenomenon in observational research. It refers to the changes in behaviour or performance that occur when individuals know they are being observed. In the context of the office scenario, people may alter their behaviour when they are aware that someone is observing them.
3. **Impact on Data Validity**: The Hawthorne effect can impact the validity of the data collected. When people change their behaviour due to the presence of an observer, the data may no longer represent their natural or typical actions. This can lead to inaccurate or biased data.
4. **Psychological Effects**: People may become more self-conscious, anxious, or motivated to perform better when they know they are being observed. They may adapt their behaviour to meet perceived expectations.
5. **Research Experiments and Confounding Variables**: Even when the intention is to conduct an experiment, it can be challenging to distinguish whether the observed changes in behaviour are due to the experiment's factors (e.g., changes in the office environment) or the observer's presence. This can create confounding variables that complicate data interpretation.
6. **Ethnographic Research**: Despite the Hawthorne effect and other challenges, ethnographic research remains a valuable method for gaining contextual insights. Researchers must be aware of these challenges and take steps to mitigate their impact on the data.
7. **Ethical Considerations**: When conducting observational research, researchers must consider ethical issues related to informed consent, privacy, and the potential impact on participants. It's essential to ensure that participants are comfortable with the observation and are aware of its purpose.
8. **Unintended Consequences**: The presence of an observer can lead to unintended consequences that influence the behaviour of those being observed. Researchers should be mindful of these consequences in their data analysis and interpretation.

It is important to be aware of the Hawthorne effect and its potential impact on observational research. While the Hawthorne effect can complicate data collection, researchers can still use observational methods effectively by carefully considering the context and its potential influence on participants' behaviour.

#### 3.3.2  Auto-ethnography

We discuss the auto-ethnography highlighting how it can be a valuable research method for gaining insights into one's own behaviour and experiences.

1. **Auto-ethnography**: Auto-ethnography is a research method that involves studying oneself. Instead of observing other people, researchers engage in introspection to gain a deeper understanding of their own patterns, behaviours, and experiences. It allows individuals to study their own actions and interactions from both personal and scientific perspectives.
2. **Rich Data Collection**: Auto-ethnography can provide rich data about one's own actions, habits, and daily routines. By reflecting on personal experiences and behaviours, researchers can gain insights into their own decision-making processes, thought patterns, and motivations.
3. **Contextual Understanding**: Auto-ethnography helps researchers gain a contextual understanding of their own actions. It allows them to explore the "why" behind their behaviours and decisions. This method can uncover the subtle nuances and motivations that drive personal actions.
4. **Field Study Approach**: Ethnography, whether auto-ethnography or the traditional method, is often conducted as a field study. Researchers immerse themselves in real-life settings, such as workplaces or communities, to observe and understand the interactions and behaviours of individuals in their natural environment.
5. **Advantages of Ethnographic Research**: Ethnographic research, whether focused on self or others, provides valuable data for designing systems and software. It allows for the exploration of social conventions, daily habits, communication patterns, and cultural aspects that influence human behaviour.
6. **Design Implications**: The insights gained from ethnographic research, including auto-ethnography, can inform the design and development of systems and software. By understanding how people interact with technology and each other, designers can create more user-centred and context-aware solutions.

Auto-ethnography is a valuable research method for those seeking to gain a deeper understanding of their own actions, behaviours, and decision-making processes. It allows individuals to approach research from a personal perspective while also considering the broader scientific context, ultimately leading to insights that can inform the design of systems and software that better align with human behaviours and needs.

### 3.4 Existing Data

#### 3.4.1 Desired Path

> **Desired Path**
> 
> In this lecture, the professor discusses the concept of "desire paths" and how it relates to both physical and system design. Desire paths refer to the most efficient or preferred route that individuals take, often deviating from the designated or expected paths. This concept can be applied to various aspects of design, including geographic locations, user interfaces, and payment systems.
> 
> The professor starts by illustrating the idea of desire paths in a physical context. For example, when people encounter a grassy area with a designated path but wish to reach a particular point, they often choose the most direct and efficient route across the grass, thus creating their own path. This behaviour represents a deviation from the expected route.
> 
> The concept of desire paths can also be applied to system design, specifically payment systems. The professor introduces a scenario involving a complex ticket machine with multiple payment options, such as cash, credit cards, checks, and even cryptocurrency. While offering various payment methods seems beneficial, it can lead to user confusion and make it challenging to find the right route through the system. The more input options a system provides, the more complicated it becomes for users to navigate, leading to inefficiencies and potential usability issues.
> 
> The professor emphasises the importance of designing systems that align with users' needs and expectations. In the case of payment systems, simplification and alignment with users' mental models can enhance the user experience. The professor notes that in such systems, the "Help" button is often the most frequently used feature, indicating that users frequently encounter difficulties. Thus, it is crucial to simplify the experience, label options clearly, and reduce unnecessary complexity.
> 
> Ultimately, the concept of desire paths serves as a valuable tool for designers, as it highlights the importance of aligning designs with user preferences and expectations. By recognising users' most efficient routes or preferences, designers can create more intuitive and user-friendly systems, improving the overall user experience. This approach encourages designers to simplify and streamline their designs to minimise user confusion and frustration.

The above discussion emphasise that this data provides designers with a starting point for making informed decisions on how to enhance the system. By recognising the desire paths and user preferences, designers can simplify the user experience and streamline the payment process. This could involve reducing the number of payment options, improving button labelling and placement, or addressing other usability issues that users commonly encounter.

The key takeaway is that existing data, represented by the desire paths and user behaviours, can serve as a foundation for designing a better next version of the system. By leveraging this information, designers can create more user-friendly and efficient systems that align with the way people naturally interact with them. This iterative design process helps ensure that future versions of the system are better tailored to users' needs and expectations.

#### 3.4.2  Using Existing Data

We explore the significance of using existing data in the design and development of new systems. While earlier professor discussed the collection of original data, existing data, particularly in the form of log data and reviews, can be immensely valuable for informing design decisions and improving the user experience.

##### 3.4.2.1 Log Data

Log data, often associated with website analytics, provides insights into how users interact with a system. By tracking user journeys through the system, we can understand their behaviour. For instance, the time spent on each page can indicate the level of user engagement. By observing these analytics, we can identify positive or negative experiences within the system. Analysing exit points can also provide crucial information. When users leave the system from a particular page, it may signal either that they found what they needed and are content or that they had a negative experience. The data isn't context-rich, but it is a valuable source for identifying trends and patterns among users.

##### 3.4.2.2 Review Pre-existing Products

Reviews can offer further insights into what matters to users. By assessing user reviews of similar products, we can extract features, both positive and negative, to understand their preferences. This data can be used to amalgamate the most favourable features into the design of a new system, creating a more positive user experience.

##### 3.4.2.3 Key Takeaway

The takeaway here is that existing data sources, whether log data, reviews, or other forms of analysis, can serve as a foundation for enhancing the design of new systems. By learning from the experiences of others and avoiding their mistakes, designers can create systems that better align with user needs and expectations. This iterative approach to design encourages the development of systems that offer improved user experiences and maximise user satisfaction. Therefore, using existing data is a practical and effective way to inform design decisions and validate assumptions in the pursuit of creating superior systems.

Overall, the above highlighted the importance of leveraging standards, principles, and design patterns to guide the creation of effective and user-friendly systems.

### 4.2 Information Architecture

We explored the organization and structuring of information for meaningful access. Information can come in various formats such as binary, text, visuals, charts, and graphs, each with its own descriptive value. The process of turning data into information involves imparting knowledge and context to give it meaning. Information, whether in the form of language or other types, carries meaning and can be represented in different ways.

The importance of structuring information appropriately was emphasised, especially in the context of building systems where users need to access information. For example of building a website and its significance of a descriptive structure that facilitates navigation. The challenge lies in understanding how people will navigate through the system and ensuring that information is organised in a meaningful way.

Different strategies for structuring information, such as categorisation based on alphabetical order or physical relationships. For example, organising a grocery store by illustrate the need for a structure that aligns with users' expectations, making their journey through the information more intuitive. The goal is to create a structure that minimizes the steps users need to take to achieve their intended goals.

In conclusion, this section underscored the importance of thoughtful information structuring in interaction design, aiming to align with users' cognitive models and provide a seamless and efficient access experience.

#### 4.2.1 LATCH technique

We explore the organization and structuring of information in meaningful ways. One of the way is the LATCH technique, which stands for Location, Alphabet, Time, Category, and Hierarchy, as a strategy for organising information.

1. **Location:** Information can be organised based on geographic locations, such as grouping products sourced locally on a website or displaying restaurants within a certain proximity for users seeking food.

2. **Alphabet:** Alphabetical organization is a common method, but it can be challenging, especially when dealing with location names or categories where standardisation is crucial to avoid confusion.

3. **Time:** Time-based organization is useful for scheduling events, managing calendars, and prioritising tasks. It helps avoid clashes between events and can be applied to various contexts, such as sorting emails based on when they were received.

4. **Category:** Categories can be generated organically, considering factors like weight classes in sports or the number of bedrooms in houses. Categories are effective for organising large data sets and enabling meaningful comparisons.

5. **Hierarchy:** Hierarchy involves organising data in a tree-like structure, often derived from categorical data. For example, a family tree illustrates relationships between ancestors, grandparents, parents, and children. Hierarchy is useful for analytics and refining data based on specific structures.

This section emphasises the importance of considering the nature of the information and the goals of the interaction when choosing an organisational strategy. While LATCH provides a foundation, the process requires thoughtful consideration and may vary based on user knowledge, data characteristics, and specific contexts. Organising information is advantageous as humans naturally seek structure, and LATCH offers a basis for effective organization.

### 4.3 Card Sorting

The section discusses the importance of involving users in defining and describing information architectures, emphasising the need for user-centered design. The technique introduced for this purpose is called **card sorting**.

1. **Overview of Card Sorting:**
   - Users are given cards representing different pages or components of a system.
   - The goal is to have users describe the interactions or structures they envision for the system.
   - It is recommended that we start at a high level (e.g., pages) and later moving to more granular levels (e.g., individual elements on a page).

2. **User-Driven Interaction Descriptions:**
   - Users can provide input on the sequence or orientation of pages, indicating the order in which they would interact with them.
   - The process involves restructuring data or pages based on the feedback received from users.
   - Users can also describe where individual elements should be placed on a page, contributing to the overall structure.

3. **Adaptable Approach:**
   - The card sorting technique is flexible and can be adapted to different exercises.
   - It allows users to express preferences, providing insights into their mental models regarding information organization.

4. **Informing Better Design Decisions:**
   - User feedback gathered through card sorting helps in understanding how information should be organised.
   - The technique aids in establishing a one-to-one relationship between user expectations and the designed interface.
   - The more user feedback received, the better the design decisions can be informed.

5. **User-Centered Information Architecture:**
   - Information architecture should not solely rely on designer perspectives but should actively seek user input.
   - Card sorting is presented as one of many techniques to gather user feedback and enhance the design process.

This section underscores the collaborative nature of information architecture development, where user insights play a crucial role in creating interfaces that align with user expectations and mental models.
