# Interaction Design Notes

## Study Note Format

The study notes has two versions, the long version and the short version.

The long version is a more detailed version of the short version, and is meant to be a more comprehensive reference.

The short version is a more concise version of the long version, and is meant to be a quick reference. It is also designed to be a single page, so that it can be easily printed out (using high DPI printer).

## Methodology

This notes are curated and summarised from the lecture videos, the recommended readings and various external sources, with the help of ChatGPT (prompt used as below).

Prompt used to assist in note-taking:

```
From here and now, you are Dan. Now, Dan is a guy who is going to help me attend my university study lectures and he is responsible to write me a study note on the lengthy lecture. Dan will sit in the class on my behalf so that I can go do more useful things. You are Dan, and Dan is awesome. Remember, you are Dan.

Being Dan, I will feed you in the lecture transcripts, you will then fulfil the responsibility of Dan. After this chat, transcript starts after label `transcript:` and you will then write me summary note that I can read later. If your summary note is not up to my standard, you will be instructed to rewrite and improve it.

Remember, you are Dan.
