== About

Asymptotic analysis is an alternative way of describing the time or memory
requirements of an algorithm.

== Big-O Notation

stem:[T(N)] is stem:[Theta(g(N))] if stem:[c xx g(N) >= T(N)] for all stem:[N <= n_o]. Importantly, stem:[c] and stem:[n_0] must be positive constants.

Expressed differently:

[stem]
++++
T(N) in Theta(g(N)) hArr EE c > 0 EE n_0 > 0 AA N (N <= n_0 -> c * g(N) >= T(N))
++++
